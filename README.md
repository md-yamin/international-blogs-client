International Blogs

Project Overview: This is a blog posting website.Any user as long as logged in can post blogs and add blogs to their wishlist.<br/>
This website features:<br/>
1. Email and Google sign in and sign up<br/>
2. Private routing<br/>
3. Search<br/>
4. Make Comment<br/>

This was a very fun project to work on. The search functionality was tricky. But I was able to make it by reading mongobd's documentation and using their text search query. This made it very simple and easy.
